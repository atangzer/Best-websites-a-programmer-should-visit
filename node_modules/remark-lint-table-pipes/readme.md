## What is this?

This package checks that table rows have initial and final delimiters.
Tables are a GFM feature enabled with [`remark-gfm`][github-remark-gfm].

## When should I use this?

You can use this package to check that tables are consistent.

## Presets

This plugin is included in the following presets:

| Preset | Options |
| - | - |
| [`remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide) | |

## Install

This package is [ESM only][github-gist-esm].
In Node.js (version 16+),
install with [npm][npm-install]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-table-pipes
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esm-sh]:

```js
import remarkLintTablePipes from 'https://esm.sh/remark-lint-table-pipes@5'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esm-sh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import remarkLintTablePipes from 'https://esm.sh/remark-lint-table-pipes@5?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

On the API:

```js
import remarkLint from 'remark-lint'
import remarkLintTablePipes from 'remark-lint-table-pipes'
import remarkParse from 'remark-parse'
import remarkStringify from 'remark-stringify'
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {unified} from 'unified'
import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'

const file = await read('example.md')

await unified()
  .use(remarkParse)
  .use(remarkLint)
  .use(remarkLintTablePipes)
  .use(remarkStringify)
  .process(file)

console.error(reporter(file))
```

On the CLI:

```sh
remark --frail --use remark-lint --use remark-lint-table-pipes .
```

On the CLI in a config file (here a `package.json`):

```diff
 ‚Ä¶
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     ‚Ä¶
     "remark-lint",
+    "remark-lint-table-pipes",
     ‚Ä¶
   ]
 }
 ‚Ä¶
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
It exports no additional [TypeScript][typescript] types.
The default export is
[`remarkLintTablePipes`][api-remark-lint-table-pipes].

### `unified().use(remarkLintTablePipes)`

Warn when GFM table rows have no initial or final cell delimiter.

###### Parameters

There are no options.

###### Returns

Transform ([`Transformer` from `unified`][github-unified-transformer]).

## Recommendation

While tables don‚Äôt require initial or final delimiters (the pipes before the
first and after the last cells in a row),
it arguably does look weird without.

## Fix

[`remark-stringify`][github-remark-stringify] with
[`remark-gfm`][github-remark-gfm] formats all tables with initial and final
delimiters.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained
versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of
Node.
This means we try to keep the current release line,
`remark-lint-table-pipes@5`,
compatible with Node.js 16.
